# Detection-Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project was designed to create a robust, isolated environment for replicating and analyzing various cyber attack techniques in a controlled setting. The primary goal was to simulate realistic threat scenarios by generating test telemetry and malicious activity, enabling the ingestion, correlation, and interpretation of logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Through this immersive, hands-on experience, I enhanced my skills in threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. The project also deepened my understanding of attacker behavior, network defense mechanisms, and the strategic use of threat intelligence to improve organizational security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
